# Marooned - Simple space adventure game

This is my hobby project for summer 2023.

Live game is here: https://jarppe.github.io/marooned

## Status

It's not finished, and _(considering my past work on hobby projects)_ most probably never will.

## Tech

Programming language is [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/), visualizations are pure SVG without any libraries, for sounds I used [Howler JS](https://howlerjs.com/).
